    <h1>Battleship Rules</h1>
    <h2>Game Overview</h2>
    <p><strong>Battleship</strong> (also known as <em>Battleships</em>) is a strategy-based guessing game for two players.</p>
    <p>Each player places their fleet of warships on a **ruled grid** (paper or board). The objective is to **sink all opponent's ships**.</p>
    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Each player secretly arranges their ships on a ”5x5“ grid.</li>
        <li>Players take turns guessing a grid position to "fire" at the opponent's board.</li>
        <li>If a ship is ”hit“, that position is marked as a hit.</li>
        <li>If the shot “misses”, that position is marked as a miss.</li>
        <li>The game continues until one player hits all opponent's ships.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Grid Colors</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Red</span> - A “hit” on an opponent's ship.</li>
        <li><span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Blue</span> - A “miss” (no ship in that position).</li>
        <li><span style="color: gray; font-weight: bold;">Gray</span> - Ship's position.</li>
    </ul>
